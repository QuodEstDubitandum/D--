# About D--

Are you tired of C++ because you keep running into compile errors and your memory management can best be described as "stick to a GC"?

No worries, D-- is here to change this. With D--, you dont have to worry about memory or compile errors cause its not gonna inform you about any errors, you will eventually find them in production :) 

Initially I wanted to build an interpreted language and started with the first concept of a lexer/parser in Go. But I decided to rather write a compiler instead and focus a bit more on performance, so I abandoned it and will write the compiler in Rust eventually. Also probably will use an existing parser instead of implementing one on my own.
